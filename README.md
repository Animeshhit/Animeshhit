# Full Stack Web Developer & Java Developer

Hey there! I'm a full-stack web developer and Java developer with a passion for building robust, scalable, and intuitive web applications. 

## Front-end Development

In my front-end work, I leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft engaging and visually appealing user interfaces. I am also proficient in popular front-end frameworks like React, Next js which allow me to build responsive, dynamic, and interactive web applications.

## Back-end Development

For back-end development, I specialize in Nodejs, Java and its associated frameworks like Spring Boot and Hibernate. I have experience working with relational databases like MySQL, as well as non-relational databases like MongoDB. 

## Full Stack Experience

With my full-stack experience, I can take a project from conception to completion, handling both front-end and back-end development tasks. I also have experience working with cloud platforms like AWS, and I am comfortable working with tools like Git, JIRA, and Slack for project management and collaboration.
